## Quick-Links Astro Site
 I created this card that contains my social links and little bio about me and what I do, using Astro.  
 Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.

 # Description
 The documentation provided is really detailed hence makes it is easier to comprehend. It was my first time using the framework and although my project wasn't that big I had a smooth time learning. It is very simple and fast true to their slogan.  
  One thing Astro is known for is the component and layout features. You create components like header or foooter or card that you get to asign to many pages without the copy and paste in every page. Same goes for the layout you create a layout that can be applied in multiple pages with copy pasting.  
  With Tailwind intergration you don't need to create a css file, as for JavaScrpit you get to write your code on the same page as the HTML, isn't that cool!!
 
 ## Installation
 To Install Astro you use the package manager npm, you can run this on the terminal and VsCode terminal
 ```bash

There are a couple of interactive questions  that will follow up Including template options.  
You also get to initialize it as a Git repo during the installing process.  
What's als amaizing about astro is the intergrations with the most used frameworks like react,Vue,svelte,preact,Tailwind and so many others.
