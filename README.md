This is my professional card.
I created this card using astro.
It is my first time trying out the framework and I must say this was very smooth.
I also used Tailwind css which is supported by astro. I wanted something simple in order for me to understand how astro works ,I will definately be using it again.
What I loved most while creating this is that it was only HTML that I had to write. I feel like this was the simplest and fastest way framework to ever learn.
